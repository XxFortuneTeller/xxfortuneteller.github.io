		<h1>Welcome to Astra</h1>
		<p style="font-size:20px">
			There are many wonders and beauties in astra. Even the deepest, darkest places are filled with beauty. Creatures and humans alike live
			in perfect harmony. There are different creatures everywhere, ranging from the highest clouds in the sky to the deepest caves in the ground below.
			Though some have come and gone through time, they have always remained in unity under King Magnus and Queen Concordia's reign.

		<h1>
			Other Races
		</h1>
		<p style="font-size:20px">
			Humans
			<br>
			Humans aren't usually found in the Astra dimension, and they always choose their alignment. The humans are almost
			always found in the middle and generally come with some sort of low-grade elemental power. Werewolves, Sabers, Dragons,
			and Vampires type B are all human-creature hybrids.
			<br>
			<br>
			Astrals
			<br>
			Astrals are the keepers of the elements. They guard them, and generally have the powers of the elements they guard.
			Along with guarding the elements, they are generally psychics. The Astrals are stronger than all creatures but the
			Mythicals.
			<br>
			<br>
			Mythics
			<br>
			Mythics are the result of human-astral breeding. They have powers of all sorts, being stronger than humans. But
			they are weaker than most other races. They can sustain themselves under other creatures, but not kill them.
			<br>
			<br>
			Mythicals
			<br>
			Mythicals are made of mostly royalty. The Astral messenger, the daughters of Magnus, Queen Concordia, and even
			King Magnus himself are some of the most famous Mythicals in Astrian history. Previously, Mythicals were the most
			abundant race. They have 2 main powers. One of them is Angelic call. When used, Angelic call temporarilyturns them
			into an angel-like figure with wings. Their other main power is the spell of Astra. This spell is hard to use,
			and calls on all of the nearby energy to shoot a large circle of power. This spell disables all powers of enemies,
			and paralyzes them temporarily.
			<br>
			<br>
			Hybrids
			<br>
			Hybrids are the result of two half-humans breeding. All creatures who are half-human are hybrids between two
			half-humans. Humans, Astrals, Mythics, and Mythicals were all results of hybrids and are different varieties of
			humans. If other creatures such as elves and Astrals or Saber Type B's (Half human, half cat) and Astrals were to
			breed with one another, it would result in a half-human astral.
